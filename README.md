# DnDCharGen

This is just an archive of an old project dating back to 2015. I cannot vouch for if the code is bad or not.
The only oversight that is missing from it is that the character stats do not take into consideration your race. It does not add the ability score differences that are determined by your race to your stats. That would need to be done afterwards.
